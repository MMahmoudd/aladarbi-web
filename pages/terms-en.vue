            <h2 class="sub2">8-2-4</h2>

            <h2 class="sub2">8-4-2</h2>

            <h2>9- Controls:</h2>
            <p>
                When using the program, all members agree to be fully and adequately informed of all legal obligations and controls applicable in each country (in the country from which the shipment is sent and in the destination of receipt, provided that the two locations are in different countries). In this sense, the parties shall abide by, for example, but not limited to, all the technical and legal obligations and controls imposed by states or transportation.
                <br>

In addition, Ala Darbi is not responsible and disclaims any responsibility for all shipments or any of them.

            <h2>10- Not delivering the shipment or defective shipment:</h2>

            <h2 class="sub">10-1 Non-delivery of the shipment:</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned above, the traveler carries out the delivery of the thing by exerting the required effort. In the event that the thing is not delivered at the time and place agreed upon with the sender due to failure to make such an effort, the responsibility for non-delivery, as a general rule, rests with the traveler.
                <br>
                If the non-delivery occurred as a result of the intervention of a third party (such as the police), the liability will be determined on a case-by-case basis, based on the investigation that you conduct on Ala Darbi. In all cases, the traveler must provide official evidence regarding the above.
             <br>
                If the traveler is unable to complete the delivery process due to the recipient’s non-commitment (for example, the recipient is not present at the meeting place), then the traveler will keep the thing for 7 days. In the event that the recipient does not claim the thing during the aforementioned period of time, it will incur charges on Ala Darbi to transport the thing to the receiving point through the program.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub">10.2 Defective Product</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned above, the traveler carries out the delivery of the thing by exerting the required effort. In the event that something defective was delivered due to failure to make such an effort, the responsibility for delivering the defective thing to the recipient rests with the traveler.
                <br>
                If the damage is caused by a third party (such as the police), the passenger must file a report of the incident to the airline and claim compensation.
            </p>

            <h2>11- Payment</h2>

            <h2 class="sub">11.1 Service Fees:</h2>
            <p>You must agree to the following conditions before approving your registration as a driver: \ n- If the price of the trip is less than 500 riyals, 15% will be charged as the application commission. \ n- If the price of the trip is less than 1000 riyals, 50 riyals will be charged as the application commission. \ n- If the price of the trip is more than 1000 riyals, 100 riyals will be charged as the application commission.</p>

            <h2 class="sub">11-2 Cancellation:</h2>
            <p>
                In the event that the parties cancel the request, they must agree on the conditions for returning the item and a notice to Ala Darbi to cancel the service so that the retained funds can proceed.
                <br>
                The parties agree that Ala Darbi is a communication app that does not provide any transportation services and does not act as a carrier, shipper, or receiver, and therefore its responsibility is to operate and provide its own program for this purpose.
            </p>

            <h2>12- Right to withdraw:</h2>
            <p>In accordance with the applicable system, you have the right to withdraw. But this right will not be permanent. Accordingly, you acknowledge that you will not have that right from the moment the sender and the traveler agree to carry out the delivery process, until the application goal of linking people to each other has been fully achieved.</p>

            <h2>Policy on Ala Darbi during the trip</h2>
            <p>
                We, at Aly Dari, care about our captains, our customers, and our colleagues alike, and everyone of course appreciates the work and dedication of the Captains, as they are the partners we trust to deliver us from one place to another or to deliver our children or even to deliver our things, in hundreds of cities. Please pay attention to the following points, to keep together this level of service and trust.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub">Be generous with the captain</h2>

                <li>Please cooperate with the captain and deliver the package or freight to be delivered</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>To pay in cash: Try to keep an adequate amount with you, or you can choose to pay on delivery.</li>
                <li>Late payment or non-payment of the amount may cause unfortunately to ban your account at Ala Darbi.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="sub">Use GPS to locate departure or arrival points</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Always use GPS and help the captain with verbal guidance if the address is complicated.</li>
                <li>Notify the Captain if you prefer a certain route.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 class="sub">Be ready when a Captain arrives and try to avoid canceling rides for no reason</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Finding a place to park can be difficult to find at times, so try not to make the captain wait too long.</li>
                <li>Be waiting for the Captain as soon as he arrives at the launch to avoid waiting or cancellation charges. The captain has the right to cancel the trip if you exceed the waiting period for you between 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="sub">Thank you, Captain, for his distinguished service</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Thank the captain and give him a 5-star rating if you enjoyed sending your shipment, or a tip if you like.</li>
                <li>Be fair in your rating of a Captain, as a low rating affects a captain's rewards and income.</li>
                <li>Ride prices, peak prices, traffic and weather conditions are beyond the Captain's control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="sub">Safety is your priority, and do not engage in any illegal activity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No alcohol or drugs.</li>
                <li>Do not ask the captain to break the law, do not ask, for example, to exceed the speed limit, or to stop where parking is prohibited.</li>
                <li>Any acts against the law may lead to legal prosecution.</li>
                <li>The captain must review the shipment and its contents to ensure that it is safe and does not contain any prohibited substances according to Regulation No. "1.13"</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to block or disable an account?</h2>
            <p>The customer's account can be banned automatically through the application on Ala Darbi if we find that the account violates any of the terms and conditions of the system, which all users accept when creating an account within the application on Ala Darbi.</p>
            <p>Here are some of the most common reasons for an account ban:</p>

            <h2 class="sub">High trip cancellation rates</h2>
            <p>
                When requesting a ride, the customer has an option to cancel sending their shipment. On the other hand, if the cancellation is repeated often, a warning message will appear on the screen. If this persists, the account will be banned, because continuing to cancel sending shipments causes a lot of confusion and wastes the Captain's time.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub">Use more than one account on the same phone</h2>
            <p>To limit fraudulent activity, each phone is allowed a limited number of active accounts. Once the account numbers exceed the limit, they are banned permanently.</p>

            <h2>What is the travel insurance service?</h2>
